He was training his juniors and working with them all the same to attain experience. In his final year, Yash had IIM calls as well as placement offers in several top notch companies across the country but he'd rather hustle to make his dream work than punch clock for someone else's. The paucity of funds resulted him in taking up a temporary job in Indore to provide for his startup. Our now COO joined him around that time as an intern. While still in college, Aayushi decided to look after the affairs of the company during the day while Yash sir ran the operations at dawn.  This is the arrangement they worked out from April to October 2019.

                        <h1>Our First International Client</h1>
                            <p>They started reaching out to international and verified businesses shortly after and gave them tremendous results in growth marketing and sales.
                                In a couple of months they'd increased their team size considerably. One and a half years in Corona, they were well set, working with Series A, Series B firms, as well as international clients from Dubai and Canada.

                        <h1>New Offices</h1>
                            <p>Following this, they opened their new office in Bhawarkuwan, Indore. Pandemic brought Feedbox to square one, but without losing heart, they started working to build a local team, calling employees from nearby towns to join them in working in office. They opened an SEO office in Jodhpur in the July of 22. Their existing office was small so they decided to move to their 3rd office which has a capacity to host 50 people. This was in October, exactly 3 years after they opened their first office.</p>

                                Their innovative solutions, excellent customer service, and the spirit of pushing boundaries was met by the overwhelming MP Young Achievers Award presented to them by the CM of Madhya Pradesh Shri Shivraj Singh Chauhan himself. Feedbox was among the top 10 start-ups to receive a banner shoutout in the CM house.
